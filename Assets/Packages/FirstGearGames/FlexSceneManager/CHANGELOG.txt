2020/11/25
	- Breaking changes.
		+ Additional parameters for loading and unloading are now set as LoadOptions / UnloadOptions, and can be optionally passed into load and unload methods. This is to declutter method signatures and allow for new options without breaking signatures in future releases.

	- New features.
		+ Connection scenes can now optionally be automatically unloaded on the server when all players exist. This was the default behavior but is now optional should you want to keep the scene running.
		+ object[] Params introduced into Load/UnloadOptions. This allows you to specify any type of parameters on the server which you can refer back to during event callbacks. Such as including a matchId into your load call so you know which match was loaded upon the OnLoadSceneEnd callback.

2020/11/19
	- Breaking Changes.
		+ FlexSceneManager API CHANGES:
			OnClientSceneChangeStart, OnClientSceneChangeEnd have been removed. In place there is now

			Shared Scene stacking example now uses API changes.
	- Fixes.
		+ Fixed streamed scenes not unloading on clients when they no longer need the scene.
		+ Fixed shared scene stacking not unloading properly on clients.
